## 1. Python Concepts - Sharing & Synthesizing

We will go over many of these concepts in more detail in the coming weeks, so no problem if it takes a little time for them to make sense!

One note about the code snippets below: in Python, we can write comments by using the `#` symbol; anything after this symbol is not interpreted as code or executed. This can be a really convenient way to write notes to yourselves (or future developers!) when trying to understand code you wrote.

- What observations did you have from the exercise?

### Data Types

- What is a **data type**?
- What are examples of different **data types** that you saw?

  - strings (ex: `'asdf'`, `'hello my name is x'`, `'a'`, `'123'`)
  - integers (ex: `1`, `-100`, `1383234`)
  - floats (floating point values) (ex: `1.0`, `-100.1234`, `0.0000003`, `1e5`)
  - booleans (ex: `True`, `False`)


  (more data types that weren't shown in this exercise will be discussed in later sessions)

### Variables

- What is a **variable**? What's an example?

  Some word (starting with a letter, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscore `_`) that represents some value. We set the value of a variable with `=`, for example: `test_var = 10` sets the **variable** `test_var` to be equal to the value of `10`. Setting the value of a variable is often called _assigning_ a variable.

- “A bucket” where you can store some value for later use in your program

- Has unique name 
    - Can contain letters, numbers or underscores, but can’t start from number
    - Case-sensitive
    - Can’t be the same as Python language keywords

- Has type
    - int, float, bool, string and some more will come later

- Has value
    - Python “guesses“ the type of the variable by the first value assigned to it

- Valid variable names: name, last_name, _first_name, name1
- Invalid variable names: 4name, -name, last_$name, 100


  ```python
    num = 3
    print(num, type(num))
    # outputs: ->
    Num = -5
    print(Num, type(Num))
    # outputs: ->

    pi = 3.14
    print(pi, type(pi))
    # outputs: ->
    smallNumber = 3E-10
    print(smallNumber, type(smallNumber))
    # outputs: ->

    b1 = True
    print(b1, type(b1))
    # outputs: ->
    b1 = False
    print(b1, type(b1))
    # outputs: ->

    letters = "abcdefghijk"
    newString = letters
    print(letters, type(letters))
    # outputs: ->
    print(newString, type(newString))
    # outputs: ->
  ```
#### Change Data Type
  ```python
    a="6"
    b=5
    c=str(b)+a
    c
  ```
   ```python
    print('Enter your name')
    name = input()
    print('Hello, ')
    print(name)
     ```

#### f-strings

##  First Python Script
### "Hello, World!" in Python

It's something of a tradition in the Computer Science world when learning a new language to write code that outputs "Hello, World!". Check out [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) for more information on why :).


For today, go ahead and try that out in [this Python playground](https://trinket.io/python/f7ad7f9864), which will allow you to execute some test code by clicking on the Play button (triangle) on the top of the console window.



<!--
### write code that outputs "Hello, World!"


Tip: there is a built-in `print` function in Python that takes some input and outputs this to standard out (`STDOUT`), which is in this case the right side of the playground console.
(Recall that the `#` stands for a "comment" in Python, meaning that this line is just a "note" to yourself and does not need to be included.)

Example usage:

```python
print("Good evening!")
# outputs -> Good evening!
print("my name is", "Nesli")
# outputs -> my name is Nesli
```

```python
# This is my first Python script
# write code that outputs "Hello, World!"
# write code that outputs "My name is "your name""
```



<!-- A Solution:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
``` -->

### "Interactive Programming"

```python
print('Enter your name')
name = input()
print('Hello, ')
print(name)
```

```python
name = input('Enter your name\n')
age = int(input('Enter your age\n'))

print('Hello,', name,)
print('In 5 years you\'ll be', age + 5)
```
