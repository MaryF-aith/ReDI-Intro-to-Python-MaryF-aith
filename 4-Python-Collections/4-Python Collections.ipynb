    "### List\n",
    "Lists are one of the more complex Python data types. Lists hold other data types like strings, integers, floats, and even lists. Each list item has an index, like strings. The index starts from 0. Just as with strings, the `len` function also gives you the length of a list. Also like strings, you can slice a list, which means to get some part of the overall list. Here are some examples to illustrate this:\n",

    "Dictionaries are a Python data structure. While lists allow you to create ordered collections of values, dictionaries allow you to create collections of key / value pairs. The contents of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { }, e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }. The \"empty dict\" is just an empty pair of curly braces {}. An analogy for a dictionary is a telephone book: you can look up a telephone number (value) by a person's name (key).\n",
